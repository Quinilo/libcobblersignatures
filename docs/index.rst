Welcome to libcobblersignatures's documentation!
************************************************

This library supplements the data for the ``cobbler import`` workflow. Cobbler is a server which configures your machine
to act as a bootserver, thus managing TFTP, DHCP and optionally DNS. More information about Cobbler can be found here:
`Github <https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler>`_

For more Information about what this library is for, see this documentation. I recommend starting with the
Quickstart document from the TOC below.
